# Onegin task solver

## Goal of program 

Program sorts input text file in English language only (recorded with US-ASKII standart with character values from 1 to 127) in right- and back- alphabetical order (ignoring letter case) with own qsort algorithm.

## Input

After making a programm, user should 
run programs with names of input and output files 
> (ex.: ./a.out "input.txt" "output.txt")

## Result

As a result, program writes a r-sorted, b-sorted and origonal text
to prove data safety in output text.

## Additional information 

Programm uses my_qsort as main algorithm. Using debug_mode user can sure
in correctness of comporators and programm and compare times of running with "time.h"
